   ollama serve
   ```

4. **Verify the Server:**
   Confirm it's running at `http://localhost:11434`.

---

## **Usage**

### **Calling Locally Hosted LLMs**

Use Fluxion to interact with locally hosted LLMs. For example:

```python
from fluxion.core.modules.llm_modules import LLMQueryModule, LLMChatModule
from fluxion.models.message_models import Message, MessageHistory

# Initialize the LLMQueryModule
llm_query = LLMQueryModule(endpoint="http://localhost:11434/api/generate", model="llama3.2")
response = llm_query.execute(prompt="What is the capital of France?")
print("Query Response:", response)

# Initialize the LLMChatModule
llm_chat = LLMChatModule(endpoint="http://localhost:11434/api/chat", model="llama3.2")
messages = MessageHistory(messages = [Message(role="user", content="Hello!")])
response = llm_chat.execute(messages=messages)
print("Chat Response:", response)
```

---

### **Using Agents for Chat and Tool Calls**

Agents can perform tool calls dynamically:

```python
from fluxion.core.agents.llm_agent import LLMChatAgent
from fluxion.core.modules.llm_modules import LLMChatModule

# Define a tool function
def get_weather(city_name: str) -> dict:
    return {"temperature": 20, "description": "sunny"}

# Initialize the LLMChatModule
llm_module = LLMChatModule(endpoint="http://localhost:11434/api/chat", model="llama3.2")

# Initialize the agent
llm_agent = LLMChatAgent(name="WeatherAgent", llm_module=llm_module)
llm_agent.register_tool(get_weather)

# Execute a conversation
messages = MessageHistory(messages = [Message(role="user", content="What's the weather in Paris?")])
response = llm_agent.execute(messages=messages)
print("Chat with Tool Call Response:", response)
```

---


### **Using call_agent with LLMChatAgent**

`call_agent` allows dynamic invocation of agents, enabling seamless communication between agents in a modular workflow. It supports retries, backoff strategies, and fallback logic for robust execution.

Here’s how to integrate it with an `LLMChatAgent`:

```python
from fluxion.core.registry.tool_registry import call_agent
from fluxion.core.agents.llm_agent import LLMChatAgent
from fluxion.core.modules.llm_modules import LLMChatModule

# Define a tool function
def get_weather(city_name: str) -> dict:
    return {"temperature": 20, "description": "sunny"}

# Initialize the LLMChatModule
llm_module = LLMChatModule(endpoint="http://localhost:11434/api/chat", model="llama3.2")

# Initialize the agent
llm_agent = LLMChatAgent(name="WeatherAgent", llm_module=llm_module)
llm_agent.register_tool(get_weather)

# Register call_agent for dynamic agent invocation
llm_agent.register_tool(call_agent)
```

---

####  **Advanced Features**

1. **Retries**:
   - Specify the maximum number of retries for an agent call.
   - Use `retry_backoff` to introduce a delay between retries.

2. **Fallback Logic**:
   - Define a fallback function to handle cases where retries are exhausted.

3. **Example: Using Retries and Fallback**

```python
def fallback_logic(inputs):
    return {"message": "Unable to complete request. Please try again later."}

messages = MessageHistory(messages = [Message(role="user", content="What's capital of Ireland?")])
try:
    result = call_agent(
        agent_name="mock_agent",
        messages=messages,
        max_retries=3,
        retry_backoff=0.5,
        fallback=fallback_logic,
    )
    print("Agent Result:", result)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print("Error calling agent:", e)
```

#### **What This Does:**
- Retries the agent call up to three times.
- Uses a backoff delay of 0.5 seconds between retries.
- Executes the fallback logic if all retries fail.

---

### **When to Use call_agent**
- **Inter-Agent Communication**:
  - When agents need to invoke other agents dynamically in workflows.
- **Error Recovery**:
  - To handle transient failures with retries or provide fallback results for irrecoverable errors.
- **Modular Workflow Design**:
  - Enables complex workflows with minimal coupling between agents.

---

### **Building Workflows**

Fluxion supports creating workflows using agent nodes:

```python
from fluxion.workflows.agent_node import AgentNode
from fluxion.workflows.abstract_workflow import AbstractWorkflow

class CustomWorkflow(AbstractWorkflow):
    def define_workflow(self):
        node1 = AgentNode(name="Node1", agent=YourCustomAgent1())
        node2 = AgentNode(name="Node2", agent=YourCustomAgent2(), dependencies=[node1])
        self.add_node(node1)
        self.add_node(node2)

workflow = CustomWorkflow(name="ExampleWorkflow")
inputs = {"key": "value"}
results = workflow.execute(inputs=inputs)
print("Workflow Results:", results)
```

---

## **Architecture Overview**

Fluxion is designed with a modular and extensible architecture that emphasizes scalability, interoperability, and flexibility. The following key components form the foundation of Fluxion's ecosystem:

### **1. Core Components**
- **Agents**
  - The primary building blocks for creating intelligent workflows. Each agent is specialized for a particular task or functionality.
  - Types of agents include:
    - **LLMQueryAgent**: Executes single-turn tasks and queries using a language model.
    - **LLMChatAgent**: Handles multi-turn conversations with memory and context support.
    - **PlanningAgent**: Generates structured plans and executes workflows step-by-step.
    - **CoordinationAgent**: Dynamically orchestrates tasks by selecting and calling appropriate agents or tools.
    - **DelegationAgent**: Delegates tasks intelligently to other agents or handles them directly using fallback mechanisms.
  
- **Tool Registry**
  - A centralized registry for managing tools that can be called by agents or workflows.
  - Ensures input validation, metadata management, and consistent integration with LLMs.

- **Agent Registry**
  - Tracks all available agents in the system, allowing agents to dynamically discover and collaborate with each other.
  - Provides metadata for agents, including input/output schemas and descriptions, to facilitate coordination.

### **2. Modules**
- **LLM Modules**
  - Abstractions for connecting to locally or remotely hosted language models, such as those powered by Ollama.
  - Modules include:
    - **LLMQueryModule**: Executes single-turn queries.
    - **LLMChatModule**: Manages multi-turn conversational interactions, tool calls, and delegation logic.

- **IR modules**
   - **EmbeddingApiModule**: EmbeddingApiModule is a module that provides an interface to the embedding API. It can be used to get embeddings for a given text.
   - **IndexingModule**: IndexingModule is a module that provides functionalities to build semantic search indexes which can be used to search for similar documents.
   - **RetrievalModule**: RetrievalModule is a module that provides functionalities to retrieve documents from a given index.



### **3. Workflow Execution**

Fluxion enables the construction, execution, and monitoring of agent-based workflows. It integrates key components like **AgentNodes**, **AbstractWorkflows**, and orchestration adapters for external platforms like Flyte.

- **AgentNode**: Represents a workflow step with an agent, its dependencies, inputs, and outputs. Ensures proper data flow and validates outputs.
- **AbstractWorkflow**: A base class for managing workflows. It handles node addition, dependency validation, execution order, and workflow execution, with visualization support for better clarity.
- **FlyteWorkflowAdapter**: Adapts Fluxion workflows for Flyte, converting `AbstractWorkflow` into Flyte-compatible workflows and enabling external orchestration.
- **WorkflowProgressTracker**: Tracks node status and execution times, offering progress updates for workflow monitoring.

Fluxion workflows are validated for dependencies and executed in the correct order. Nodes exchange data seamlessly, enabling smooth execution for both local and orchestrated environments.


### **4. Extensibility**
Fluxion is designed to be easily extendable:
- Add new agents with custom logic and integrate them seamlessly into workflows.
- Register custom tools with the Tool Registry to expand functionality.
- Extend the architecture by creating new modules, agents, or registries for specific domains or applications.

### **5. Key Design Principles**
- **Modularity**: All components are self-contained and can be used independently or as part of a larger workflow.
- **Interoperability**: Agents and tools communicate through well-defined interfaces and schemas.
- **Flexibility**: Supports a wide range of workflows, from simple task execution to complex multi-agent orchestration.
- **Scalability**: Built to handle diverse tasks and workloads without bottlenecks.
