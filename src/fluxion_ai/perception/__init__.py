Perception module of the Fluxion core package. It implements the perception logic for the agents. The perception module is responsible for processing 
the input data and converting it into a format that the agent can understand and act upon.  It defines the abstraction around inputs to the agent,
such as input modes, input acquisition, and input processing. The perception module also provides the necessary tools for the agent to interact with
the environment and other agents.
